			<h2 class="content-left">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry (<i>Harry Potter</i>)</h2>

			<p class="content-left"><b>Visualized by its creator, J.K. Rowling, on a bustling train ride, </b>Harry Potter later became one of the best-selling book series of all time. This is undoubtedly due to the powerful imagery of the wonderful wizarding world in which a young boy realized his fate to become far more than just the boy who lived under the stairs in a house on Privet Drive. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a dynamic castle with towering parapets, gargoyles that defend, staircases that change directions, and rooms that disappear and reappear based on necessity. While the witches and wizards that roam its halls have piqued the interest of the entire world, one could argue that the magical institution has greater themes and secrets and serves as a character on its own. Perhaps, the castle is hidden beneath cloud cover and the surrounding forests and mountains as its location remains unknown to the larger world. Or, perhaps, Professor Dumbledore's potent charms and enchantments keep the school hidden from prying Muggle eyes. Nonetheless, the school serves as a challenge, a teacher, and perhaps the closest thing to home for the greatest wizard that ever lived.</p>

			<p class="content-left"><b>Situated along the central region of Arda, </b>J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth is an &quot;objectively real world&quot; to which fans and critics describe as a wasteland version of the continent of Europe as it may have existed 6000 years ago. This ancient world is a habitat for elves, dwarves, hobbits, and tons of other magical creatures. There are also dragons, goblins, and trolls. Yet, as the age of men commences, these other wonderful creatures slowly become extinct and their powers diminish. Again, here exists a place where commoners can single-handedly take on powerful dark lords to rescue civilization from a horrific end. Tolkien's classic masterpiece took him several decades to pen, but the fantasy world he created will certainly outlive us all.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="content-left"><b>Claiming the title as the longest running television show, </b>The Simpsons stole America's heart in more than a few ways. In the fictional town of Springfield, a family resides that is uniquely preposterous and witty all at once. Founded on the premise of representing similar towns across America, creator Matt Groening revealed that the location of the show was inspired by the real town of Springfield, Oregon. However, it's unlikely that the real town has as much spirit. From Moe's Tavern to the nuclear power plant that Homer has managed to screw up in time and time again, Springfield is much more than home to Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, and Maggie. The colorful and dynamic city portrays a very real way of life for blue-collar working families, with or without the dysfunction.</p>

			<h2 class="content-left">Willy Wonka&apos;s Chocolate Factory (<i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>)</h2>
			<div class="img-con-fam" style="float: right">

			</div>
			<p class="content-left"><b>Yet, another miraculous place that has tempted and amazed children for decades is Willy Wonka's famed yet fictional chocolate factory.</b> All you need is a golden ticket to be transported to a dreamy place loaded with more eccentricity and deliciousness than any other. The senses are loaded within every inch of Wonka's candy wonderland. There is wallpaper you can lick, rivers of flowing chocolate, tiny green-haired musical men, and astonishingly dreadful inventions that come at a cost to those who do not follow the rules. Most of all, this fantasy environment demonstrates how the greedy are punished and how those who are both patient and humble persevere.</p>

			<h2 class="content-left">Gotham City (<i>Batman</i>)</h2>

			</div>
			<p class="content-left"><b>For over three-quarters of a century,</b> both kids and adults alike have been intrigued by the stone and steel dwelling place of Batman. While the actual location of this mythical metropolis has never been revealed, fans reckon it is based somewhere off the east coast, perhaps a fusion of several American cities with architectural features that blend Post-Modernism, Art Deco, and Neo-Gothicism. Lots of notable crime fighters have roamed the terribly corrupted streets of Gotham, but none as notable as the Dark Knight himself. This is a shadowy city lined with skyscrapers and haunting gargoyles where super villains take on dirty cops for breakfast. Although most would normally have no desire to live in such a place, we love accompanying the caped crusader on his thrilling excursions.</p>

			<p class="content-right"><b>That the iconic logo from every Disney movie is called the Cinderella Castle?</b><br>It's one of the most iconic opening credit logos of our time, that magical Disney logo. Every man, woman, and child can spot that castle and arced shooting star a mile away and know exactly by whom the movie was made, and ergo the quality of the film they're about to watch. The sweeping instrumental version of <q>When You Wish Upon A Star</q> can even clue you in if you're not facing the television set. It's about as solid as branding goes and has yet to lose its charm after all these years. Ethan Jones created this decades-spanning retrospective.</p>
