				<h2><b>Fictional Locations Used In Narrative</b></h2>
				<p><b>Where did the story take place?</b><br>In works of narrative (especially fictional), the literary element setting includes the historical moment in time and geographic location in which a story takes place, and helps initiate the main backdrop and mood for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world or milieu to include a context (especially society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include culture, historical period, geography, and hour. Along with the plot, character, theme, and style, setting is considered one of the fundamental components of fiction, and novelist Donna Levin has described how this social milieu shapes the characters' values. The elements of the story setting include the passage of time, which may be static in some stories or dynamic in others with, for example, changing seasons.&nbsp;<cite>Wikipedia</cite></p>

				<h3><b>7 Fictional Places We Wish We Could Live In</b></h3>
				<p><i>(Taken from Buzzfeed)</i></p>
				<p><b>1. King's Landing, <i>Game of Thrones</i></b><br>If you're going to be living in wildly violent times, you might as well do it in somewhere as gorgeous as King's Landing.<br><b>2. Hogwarts, <i>The Harry Potter Series</i></b><br>If you aren't still waiting for your acceptance letter you've simply given up on your dreams.<br><b>3. South Park, <i>South Park</i></b><br>OK, so there really is a place called South Park, Colorado, but it's not like we can go to the cartoon one...<br><b>4. Bikini Bottom, <i>Spongebob Squarepants</i></b><br>Who lives in a pineapple under the sea!? Well damn. I wish it was me!<br><b>5. The Shire, <i>The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey</i></b><br>With all the natural beauty and peacefulness of the shire, who could blame Bilbo Baggins for not wanting to leave?<br><b>6. Gotham City, <i>Batman</i></b><br>So what if sometimes things get a little scary and violent? Batman will be there to save the day!<br><b>7. Narnia, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia Series</i></b><br>First things first, you go through a secret wardrobe to get to Narnia. If that weren't enough to make you want to live there, don't forget about the majestic scenery and talking animals!</p>

				<h3><b>Did you know?</b></h3>
				<img class="content" src="CSS/disney.jpg">
				<p><b>That the iconic logo from every Disney movie is called the Cinderella Castle?</b><br>It's one of the most iconic opening credit logos of our time, that magical Disney logo. Every man, woman, and child can spot that castle and arced shooting star a mile away and know exactly by whom the movie was made, and ergo the quality of the film they're about to watch. The sweeping instrumental version of <q>When You Wish Upon A Star</q> can even clue you in if you're not facing the television set. It's about as solid as branding goes and has yet to lose its charm after all these years. Ethan Jones created this decades-spanning retrospective.</p>
